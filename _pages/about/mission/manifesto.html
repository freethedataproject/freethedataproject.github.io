	<p>
		In the year 2020, a year marked by an unprecedented global health crisis, an
		all-time high in the number of people displaced by conflict, violence and
		disasters, the worst wildfire season in history, record hemispheric heat
		spelling an impending climate catastrophe, never-before-seen political and
		economic divisions, and countless upheavals against systemic racism,
		inequality, corruption, and oppression, we, women who write, read,
		interpret, and critique code, say ENOUGH WITH BIG TECH! 
	</p>


	<ul class="list-unstyled py-2">
		<p class = "enough-list-item">
			Enough with its hijacking of our freedom while parading as a savior amidst a
			global pandemic.
		</li>

		<p class = "enough-list-item">
			Enough with its incessant datafication of human life.
		</li>

		<p class = "enough-list-item">
			Enough with its shameless exploitation of our personal data.
		</li>

		<p class = "enough-list-item">
			Enough with its algorithms ceaselessly trying to determine our every
			decision – from where we buy groceries to who should be marked for
			“preventative” police surveillance.
		</li>

		<p class = "enough-list-item">
			Enough with its clandestine dealings with oppressive governments,
			jeopardizing the lives of dissenters and peaceful communities.
		</li>

		<p class = "enough-list-item">
			Enough with its covert military-style psychological operations seeking to
			understand and control the most intimate aspects of our humanity – our
			thoughts and emotions.
		</li>
		<p class = "enough-list-item">
			Enough with its “young boys’ club” mentality de facto discriminating
			against women, people of color and other minority groups both in the
			workplace and in the algorithms it unleashes onto society.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We recognize the recent efforts of government programs, university
		educators, community organizations, and even tech companies themselves to
		diversify STEM curricula and create spaces more inviting for women, people
		of color, members of the LGBTQ community and other marginalized groups, but
		we believe this is not enough. Much more is needed to ensure the information
		economy can meet the extraordinary challenges facing our society today in a
		just, equitable, and sustainable way.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a first step in this direction, the role of women, and especially women
		of color, in uncovering the gross violations of ethics (and sometimes the
		law) perpetrated by Big Tech ought to be acknowledged and firmly and
		decisively incorporated into the ethos, practice and training of coders and
		data scientists everywhere. From Barbara Smith’s Combahee River Collective
		and Donna Haraway’s “informatics of domination,” through Shoshana Zuboff’s
		“instrumentarian power” and Zeynep Tufekci’s “marketplace of ideas,” to
		micha cárdenas’ “android goddess,” Virginia Eubanks’ “digital poorhouse,”
		Cathy O’Neil’s “weapons of math destruction,” and Simone Browne’s “dark
		matters,” women in the last few decades have worked tirelessly to give us
		the vocabulary and critical tools to identify, describe, denounce, and
		resist what Ewa Plonowska Ziarek calls “the new forms of oppression”
		advances in technology, and Big Tech in particular, ostensibly unwittingly
		create. Women in academia have also spearheaded labs and thinktanks such as
		the AI Now Institute to critically examine the social implications of big
		science. Such liberatory projects have been undertaken by non-academic
		activists and grassroot organizations as well. Social movements such as
		#SayHerName and #BlackLivesMatter – both spearheaded by Black women who had
		had enough – effectively changed the racial justice discourse in the U.S.
		and around the world, and helped galvanize the racial reckoning following
		the murder of George Floyd. And let’s not forget the courageous
		women-whistleblowers! Just this past week, former Facebook data scientist
		Sophie Zhang posted a detailed memo replete with examples of how political
		leaders in Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Honduras and Ukraine use fake Facebook
		accounts to artificially boost social media engagement and sway public
		opinion, sparking oftentimes deadly protests and wholesale regime changes.

	<p>
		Only by striking down the rigid vertical structures of patriarchy’s hegemony
		over science and knowledge, and replacing them with the intersubjective
		relational model of data justice these exceptional women have helped create
		inspired by their own analyses and the ideas of women, people of color, and
		enlightened men before them, can we hope to avoid the disruption Big Tech is
		about to cause; disruption commensurate with the devastation predicted by
		global warming activists. […]
