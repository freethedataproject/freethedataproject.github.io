			In the year 2020, a year marked by an unprecedented global health crisis, an
			all-time high in the number of people displaced by conflict, violence and
			disasters, the worst wildfire season in history, record hemispheric heat
			spelling an impending climate catastrophe, never-before-seen political and
			economic divisions, and countless upheavals against systemic racism,
			inequality, corruption, and oppression, we, women who write, read,
			interpret, and critique code, say ENOUGH WITH BIG TECH!
		</p>


		<ul class="list-unstyled py-2">
			<p class="enough-list-item">
				Enough with its hijacking of our freedom while parading as a savior amidst a
				global pandemic.
				</li>

			<p class="enough-list-item">
				Enough with its incessant datafication of human life.
				</li>

			<p class="enough-list-item">
				Enough with its shameless exploitation of our personal data.
				</li>

			<p class="enough-list-item">
				Enough with its algorithms ceaselessly trying to determine our every
				decision – from where we buy groceries to who should be marked for
				“preventative” police surveillance.
				</li>

			<p class="enough-list-item">
				Enough with its clandestine dealings with oppressive governments,
				jeopardizing the lives of dissenters and peaceful communities.
				</li>

			<p class="enough-list-item">
				Enough with its covert military-style psychological operations seeking to
				understand and control the most intimate aspects of our humanity – our
				thoughts and emotions.
				</li>
			<p class="enough-list-item">
				Enough with its “young boys’ club” mentality de facto discriminating
				against women, people of color and other minority groups both in the
				workplace and in the algorithms it unleashes onto society.
				</li>
		</ul>

			We recognize the recent efforts of government programs, university
			educators, community organizations, and even tech companies themselves to
			diversify STEM curricula and create spaces more inviting for women, people
			of color, members of the LGBTQ community and other marginalized groups, but
			we believe this is not enough. Much more is needed to ensure the information
			economy can meet the extraordinary challenges facing our society today in a
			just, equitable, and sustainable way.

		<p class = "mission">
			As a first step in this direction, the role of women, and especially women
			of color, in uncovering the gross violations of ethics (and sometimes the
			law) perpetrated by Big Tech ought to be acknowledged and firmly and
			decisively incorporated into the ethos, practice and training of coders and
			data scientists everywhere. From Barbara Smith’s Combahee River Collective
			and Donna Haraway’s “informatics of domination,” through Shoshana Zuboff’s
			“instrumentarian power” and Zeynep Tufekci’s “marketplace of ideas,” to
			micha cárdenas’ “android goddess,” Virginia Eubanks’ “digital poorhouse,”
			Cathy O’Neil’s “weapons of math destruction,” and Simone Browne’s “dark
			matters,” women in the last few decades have worked tirelessly to give us
			the vocabulary and critical tools to identify, describe, denounce, and
			resist what Ewa Plonowska Ziarek calls “the new forms of oppression”
			advances in technology, and Big Tech in particular, ostensibly unwittingly
			create. Women in academia have also spearheaded labs and thinktanks such as
			the AI Now Institute to critically examine the social implications of big
			science. Such liberatory projects have been undertaken by non-academic
			activists and grassroot organizations as well. Social movements such as
			#SayHerName and #BlackLivesMatter – both spearheaded by Black women who had
			had enough – effectively changed the racial justice discourse in the U.S.
			and around the world, and helped galvanize the racial reckoning following
			the murder of George Floyd. And let’s not forget the courageous
			women-whistleblowers! Just this past week, former Facebook data scientist
			Sophie Zhang posted a detailed memo replete with examples of how political
			leaders in Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Honduras and Ukraine use fake Facebook
			accounts to artificially boost social media engagement and sway public
			opinion, sparking oftentimes deadly protests and wholesale regime changes.
		</p>
		<p class = "mission">
			Only by striking down the rigid vertical structures of patriarchy’s hegemony
			over science and knowledge, and replacing them with the intersubjective
			relational model of data justice these exceptional women have helped create
			inspired by their own analyses and the ideas of women, people of color, and
			enlightened men before them, can we hope to avoid the disruption Big Tech is
			about to cause; disruption commensurate with the devastation predicted by
			global warming activists. […]
