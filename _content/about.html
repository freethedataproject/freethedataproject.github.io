Free the Data joins a growing movement that calls on academics, journalists, scientists, and anyone else interested in data justice to challenge what it means to work with data. As students and faculty in a STEM field, we've brushed against the limitations of data-driven research and the inequities that are endemic to big tech and academia alike. We created Free the Data to say <em>fuck you</em> to these limitations. Our goal is not only to name the problems that we encounter at the intersection of data and society, but to explore how we can do our part to address these problems, and to invite others to join us.
</p>

<p>
Across the site, you'll find articles, visualizations, tutorials, and resources that engage with topics from fields such as information science, critical data studies, politics, science of science, and feminism. Collectively, these projects center our agency as researchers and reflect our commitment to driving data in more ethical, engaging, and empowering directions.

<p>
If you're new to data justice and critical data studies, you might start by checking out our <a href = "#">Data Justice 101 article</a>. Though it's far from exhaustive, this primer covers some of the essential figures and concepts that have helped inspire this project. And to all of those reading this, we hope you'll join us in saying: <a href = "#">ENOUGH WITH BIG DATA</a>.
