# Welcome to the Official Internal Information Hub™

Below is a collection of guides that cover how to navigate and use this site. The links below are organized, roughly, from most essential (e.g., creating and posting articles) to least essential (e.g., creating custom layouts using HTML and uikit). All of this content is stored in `root → _content → internal`(here's a link to the <a href = "https://github.com/freethedataproject/freethedataproject.github.io/tree/main/_content/internal" target = "_blank"> folder on Github </a>) if you want to make additions or edits.
