title: "Do you have to hate women to worship the rap god?"
subtitle: "This project strips away the distractions — the sardonic wordplay, the sharp beats, the power of voice and cadence — and re-contextualizes Eminem's lyrics as a time capsule of popular misogyny and toxic masculinity."

# Introduction

Eminem’s music, and his career more generally, sits uncomfortably between two poles. He’s been a consistent advocate for racial equality; he’s denounced former presidents Trump and Bush, as well as their supporters; he's created music with feminist advocates such as Beyonce; and he’s periodically apologized for some of his past sexism and homophobia. But at the same time, across the vast majority of his career, Eminem has unabashedly and relentlessly rapped about abusing, harassing, assaulting, raping, murdering, stalking, and demeaning women. 

I started this project because I wondered: Are there _any_ Eminem songs that a woman can listen to without exposing herself to misogyny? Must a bitchcuntslutwhore bracket her values and self-respect to worship the rap god?
