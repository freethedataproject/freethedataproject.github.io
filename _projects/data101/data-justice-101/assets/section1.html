<h1>What is data justice?</h1>

<div class="row px-3 my-4">
    <div class="col-md-9 px-md-5 align-self-center">
        <span class="termxl mb-0 pb-0">Data Justice</span>

        <p>
            A commitment to researching and analyzing data in ways that are equitable, morally righteous, and ethical; understanding how marginalized groups are helped or harmed by data-driven practices; and identifying and resolving structural inequities that surface in data-driven research.

                The principle that all individuals deserve to be treated, and should behave, in ways that are equitable,

    <p>Broadly, the concept of data justice has emerged in response to two interrelated problems that occur in data-driven research.</p>

    <ol>

        <li>1. The belief that data — and data-driven research — are unbiased, neutral, and/or objective.</li>
        <li>2. Ongoing structural inequalities in data-driven research that systematically harm marginalized groups.</li>
    </ol>
