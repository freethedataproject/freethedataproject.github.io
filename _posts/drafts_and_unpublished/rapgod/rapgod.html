			<h2 class="">Intro</h2>

			<p>It feels blase to ask the question; critiquing Eminem's misogynyistic lyrics has been low-hanging fruit for decades now. That the so-called GOAT raps about women and the LGBTQ+ community in derogatory, objectifying, and violent ways is hardly a secret.</p>

			<p>But I think that's the problem.</p>

			<p>
			I'm here as a <span uk-tooltip="chicka, chicka, chicka, slim shady, i'm sick of him">feminist and an Eminem fan</span>, reckoning with the fact that the BEST SELLING has built a career by throwing women under the bus (lyrically, I mean). The question that this project starts and ends with is whether being an Eminem fan in 2020—even after MeToo and Robin Thicke and R Kelly and ___ and ___ and ___ and ___ and ___ and ___ and ___ — necessarily means condoning his misogyny.
			</p>

			<p>
			More concretely, this project asks: How many Eminem songs are there that don't  objectify, stereotype, belittle, emotionally abuse, beat, rape, and/or murder a woman? Has Eminem's reliance on misogyny fluctuated over the years? Are there patterns in the kinds of misogyny he raps about? Is there a correlation between the amount of misogyny in a song and the amount of streams it gets?
			</p>

			<p>
			What follows are answers to some of these questions. The goal here isn't to condemn Eminem, to call for censorship, or to suggest that misogyny is a problem that's unique to rap. Eminem is hardly the only misogynistic artist, censorship is stupid, and there's as much work to be done (if not more) to call out misogyny in country or pop music as there is rap. It just happens to be the case that I'm an Eminem fan, and it just happens to be the case that I wish I didn't have to bracket my dignity to listen to him. Ultimately, this project is as much a call to ask these same questions of other artists that we celebrate as it is a critique of Eminem.</p>

			<p>Lastly, if you've made it this far -- and whether you keep scrolling or not--I ask that you consider DONATING. </p>
