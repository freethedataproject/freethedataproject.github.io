<p>As it turned out, it took so little effort to spot instances of misogyny in Eminem's songs that it only took me a day to answer the question that this project originally sought to answer. The short answer is <i>yes</i>, there are a handful of Eminem songs that do not contain any misogyny. About 25 songs, or roughly thirteen percent of Eminem's discography.
