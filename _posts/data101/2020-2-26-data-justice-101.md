# What is data justice?

DATA

- A collection of information and/or facts, typically used for research and analysis. 

JUSTICE 

- The principle that all individuals deserve to be treated, and should behave, in ways that are equitable, morally righteous, and ethical. 

DATA JUSTICE

- A commitment to researching and analyzing data in ways that are equitable, morally righteous, and ethical; understanding how marginalized groups are helped or harmed by data-driven practices; and identifying and resolving structural inequities that surface in data-driven research.

Broadly, the concept of data justice has emerged in response to two interrelated problems that occur in data-driven research. 

The belief that data — and data-driven research — are unbiased, neutral, and/or objective.

Ongoing structural inequalities in data-driven research that systematically harm marginalized groups.

# Why does data justice matter?

We can understand why data justice matters by looking at what happens in its absence. Below are a few examples of inequities in data-driven research that scholars and activists have identified. 

Example1
Example2
Example3 
Example4 

Data justice advocates draw attention to problems like these, study the outcomes of such inequities, strategize to develop solutions, and demand accountability and transparency from institutions that rely on data-driven practices. In short, data justice matters because people matter. It matters that we use data to reduce, rather than reproduce, inequity, oppression, and marginalization. 

Any data-driven practice that contributes to inequity, oppression, and marginalization is a pressing concern. That said, many of the concerns that data justice advocates have raised target the following areas: 

- Artificial intelligence
- Policies 
- Content regulation
- Micro-targeting
- ???

Inequities in any of these areas have rippling consequences across our lives. Among other areas, we can see the effects of inequitable data-driven practices in: 

- Policing
- Healthcare & medicine
- Advertising (?)
- Employment
- The Economy™ (? like-- credit scores; stock market; housing security; idfk) 
- Education
- Environment
- Safety (??? -- this might be too big of an umbrella bc I’m thinking about everything from attempted coups that were coordinated online to the use of crash test dummies that were only modeled on male anatomy)
- Media & social media (??? -- like, the FX of algorithms, content (ir)regulation, etc.)
- Housing
- Financial services

Data justice, however, does more than identify and challenge inequities. It also strives to empower individuals — especially those who have been historically marginalized — to use data in equitable, creative, novel, and playful ways.

# Who practices data justice?

Activists, scientists, academics, and journalists are just a few examples of data justice practitioners. Below, we highlight several influential data justice advocates and organizations. Each of these individuals and groups has informed our understanding of data justice and our commitment to its principles.

# How can I practice data justice?


Committing to data justice means asking things like:
 
- Who is conducting data-driven research? 
- What questions are (not) being asked/researched?
- What data is being collected? How is it collected? With whom is(n’t) it shared?
- In whose interest is this research being done? Who benefits? Who is harmed?
