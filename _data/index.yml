    Free the Data wants to smash the black boxes that make data inaccessible. We create articles, visual essays, and infographics that use data in compelling, interactive, and visual ways, while breaking stereotypes about who can do data analysis and what proper research topics look like. Our projects reflect a diverse set of interests that are unified by a shared commitment to driving data in more ethical, engaging, and empowering directions.

ethical: >
    Ethical data research is critical, reflexive, and justice-oriented. We interrogate the power embedded in data by examining which stories are(n't) being told with data. 

engaging: >
     Data moves; it tells stories; itâ€™s anything but static. We emphasize data's richness by designing viz and showcasing projects that are interactive, dynamic, and imaginative.

empowering: >
    We believe in smashing black boxes that make it hard to access, analyze, or afford data. We strive to help make data science more empowering by providing resources on data science and data justice.
