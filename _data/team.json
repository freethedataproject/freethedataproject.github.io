Using a critical theoretical lens and mixed qualitative methods, Sarah's research examines the dynamics between users and administrators on social media platforms. Her current work looks at how content regulation policies are constructed, taken up, and enforced on platforms such as Reddit and Facebook. Sarah hopes to use her research to inform policy decisions that protect vulnerable users and reduce the spread of harmful content online."

Her interests stem from her work in social media data and research & development projects for both the Czech Republic Government, in the Center Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats at the Ministry of Interior, as well as the TV media industry. Leni strongly believes that humans and technology should always be in balance and one should not exploit the other by any means. Leni’s ultimate goal is to educate users about practices that are in place about collection, possession, and analysis of the data they leave behind on technological platforms. Leni aims to free the knowledge, which is mostly reserved to the technological platforms and holding the tech giants accountable for what they are doing with the data they collect."

Her research focuses on the communication and information technology (ICT) drivers of prosocial behavior, and on the factors influencing online users’ engagement in acts of digital volunteerism and transethnic and transracial solidarity in particular. Jasmina is also interested in how today’s governments, political regimes, corporations and other social entities use information collection, analysis and dissemination as a highly effective and ultraprecise method of warfare. To study these phenomena, Jasmina uses a combination of critical analysis and computational analytics but hopes to strengthen her work through the inclusion of community-engaged qualitative research techniques."

Frida has hard-coded allergies to bias and systematic oppression, but don't be fooled: she'll relentlessly quash any inequities (and bugs) that get in her way. Like her namesake, Frida Kahlo, our beloved Frida Data Cat finds as much purrpose in art as she does science. When she's not crunching numbers or chasing (computer) mice, you'll likely find her catching up on her friends' latest artistic endeavors—<a href='https://fatcatart.com/?lang=en' target = '_blank' >fatcatart </a> is her current fave."
