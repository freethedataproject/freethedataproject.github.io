[{"articles":"We write about aspects of data and society that make us ask, 'What the fuck is going on here?' Through our stories, we demonstrate how each and every one of us can use data in critical, reflexive, and creative ways. ","visualstories":"\nInfographics, dashboards, graphs and #DataArt: If we can find a way to visualize something, we will. If it works, we'll share it here. (And if it doesn't, we'll probably share it here anyway. Fuck perfectionism.) ","data101":"Breaking black boxes requires acknowledging that they're bullshit; from there, the magic happens. In our Data 101 series, we share what we've learned about the process of writing scripts, breaking things, identifying problems, and experiencing the joy of fixing them. We'll do our best to break things down so you can follow each and every step! Grab some coffee and settle in for some #knowledge.","thestruggle":"If you love the possibilities that data has to offer, but feel restricted by the oppression and gatekeeping that surrounds it, you're not alone. In #TheStruggle, we reflect on the kinds of challenges, frustrations, and aspirations that we developed Free the Data to tackle.","themission":"Free the Data wants to smash the black boxes that make data inaccessible. We create articles, visual essays, and infographics that use data in compelling, interactive, and visual ways, while breaking stereotypes about who can do data analysis and what proper research topics look like. Our projects reflect a diverse set of interests that are unified by a shared commitment to driving data in more ethical, engaging, and empowering directions.","ethical":"Ethical data research is critical, reflexive, and justice-oriented. We interrogate the power embedded in data by examining which stories are(n't) being told with it. ","engaging":"Data moves; it tells stories; it’s anything but static. We emphasize data's richness by designing viz and showcasing projects that are interactive, dynamic, and imaginative.","empowering":"We believe in smashing black boxes that make it hard to access, analyze, or afford data. We strive to help make data science more empowering by providing resources on data science and data justice.","explore":"Articles, visualizations, guides, resources – Free the Data offers a little bit of everything. Below, you can use filters to find what you're looking for, or you can dive into one of our curated collections.  \n","id":"recmGKXs4f83Cvs2D"}]
